**Version 1.0.0**

Having a bad day? Breathe in and out slowlyâ€¦ or throw some chairs at your collegues. Welcome to the Y7K office brawl!


Y7K Smash Bros is a WebGL/Canvas based topdown arcade game crafted using [Phaser](https://phaser.io) as the client-side JS framework and [Socket.io](https://socket.io) for the multiplayer networking. You can chose a character and run around the [Y7K](https:77y7k.com) office. You can pick up objects and throw them around. You score if you hit others with the objects :)

The game supports multiple game rooms with up to 8 players per room.

## Installation

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `gulp build-prod` or `gulp build-dev` to build all bundles (You can also use `npm run`)
3. Run the node server with `node server/server.js` or `npm run start`
4. Open the game in the browser at `localhost:3000` 

## Development

Javascript Code is based on ES2016/Babel and built with Webpack. Serverside-Code is also bundled with Webpack, because we use Babel aswell. vendor packages are packed in their own build bundle.

- Use `gulp watch` to run webpack with filewatching and running the nodeserver with nodemon.
- Check gulpfile for other, more specific run tasks

The client side game code is built on [Phaser](https://phaser.io). Phaser renders the game to HTML5 Canvas (Canvas mode is forced over WebGL for performance reasons). For the physics simulation, [p2.js](https://github.com/schteppe/p2.js) (phaser built-in release) is used. 

The serverside Code is built based on [Socket.io](https://socket.io) and exchanges game state between different game clients via websockets. The game simulation is not run serverside and the server is therefore only authorative in some cases. 

Most Game Logic is handled in the main game state [StatePlaying](https://github.com/exophunk/y7k-smashbros/blob/master/src/js/client/states/StatePlaying.js).

Most Networking Logic is handled by the clientside Networking Handler and the serverside GameRoom 

You can monitor the current server state and active rooms by visiting `/admin`. For accessing the serveradmin page, you need to set up `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PWHASH` (BCrypt hash) in the `.env` file.
